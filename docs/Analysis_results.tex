\section*{Sequence analysis}


\section*{Phage survival}


\section*{Evolution of infectivity and resistance}
Infectivity range, in terms of the proportion of all hosts infected by phage from each timepoint, increased from 1 to 4 d.p.i. ($z = 4.326, p < 0.0001$), but did not change significantly between 4 and 9 d.p.i. ($z=-0.501, p=0.62$). Resistance range, expressed as the proportion of all phage resisted by hosts from each timepoint, increased from 1 to 4 d.p.i. ($z = 5.167, p < 0.0001$) and from 4 to 9 d.p.i. ($z=5.238$, $p < 0.0001$). There was much more variation in host resistance among genotypes at 4 d.p.i. compared to the other two timepoints (95\% CI: $1=0.05, 4=0.78, 9=0.04$). 

\section*{Time-shift}

\section*{Time-shift analysis}
Host background had an overall significant effect on phage infectivity (deviance \sub{2, 10041}$=10552.63, p<0.0001$). Over the whole dataset, phage were more infective to hosts from their past compared to the present ($z = 7.88, p<0.0001$) and future ($z = 44.74, p<0.0001$), and more infective to present compared to future hosts ($z=39.67, p<0.0001$). These relationships were the inverse when considering host resistance (see Figs.). 

This pattern of overall decreasing infectivity and increasing resistance becomes more nuanced when focussing on each individual host background (see Fig).

\end{table}


\section*{Coevolutionary dynamics}
Fluctuating selection in the phage was weak in all three timepoints, with a GxE effect contributing explaining at most 19\% of the residual variance. There was no difference in the strength of fluctuating selection among timepoints ($F\sub{2,22} = 1.314, p = 0.52$).
