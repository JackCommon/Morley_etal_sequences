# Sequence summary data #

## unique_spacers.csv
Position on the phage 2972 genome of all unique spacer sequences, representing
putative protospacer sequences

Timepoint = sample time the spacer is derived from
Replicate = replicate the spacer is derived from
Locus = CRISPR locus the spacer was detected in
ProtospacerStart = start of the BLAST hit on the genome
ProtospacerEnd = end of the BLAST hit on the genome
Sequence = the spacer sequence
Direction = if the spacer mapped forward or reverse
n = the number of clones in each replicate with a given spacer
