## [coevo_infect](coevo_infect.png)
Infectivity of phage when challenged againsts bacteria from different host environments (past, contemporary, future). Host environment refers to the time-shift relative to the phage e.g. host environment == past is when phage are challenged against hosts from timepoints preceeding them. The line is not predictive. Means and 95% CIs are shown (n=8).

## [coevo_resist](coevo_resist.png)
Resistance of hosts when challenged againsts bacteria from different host environments (past, contemporary, future). Simply 1- the values in coevo_infect. The line is not predictive. Means and 95% CIs are shown (n=8).

## [coverage_plot](coverage_plot.png)
Histogram of putative protospacer locations on the phage 2972 genome at each timepoint. Each point represents a sequenced host CRISPR loci that contained a sequence mapping to this region, derived from a BLAST search.

## [FSD_scores](FSD_scores.png)
Relative importance of fluctuating selection dynamics compared to escalating selection. Under FSD, pathogen genotypes should differ in their infectivity to hosts from contemporary and non-contemporary environments. Scores represent the ratio of the variance in infectivity due to host environment alone explained by variance in infectivity among genotypes, derived from GLMMs with environment as a fixed effect and phage genotype as a random effect. Residuals were square-root transformed to introduce a normal distribution in line with model assumptions. Means and SEs are shown (n=8).

## [infect_resist_evolution](infect_resist_evolution.png)
Evolution of phage infectivity and host resistance. Infectivity was calculated as the proportion of hosts infected by a given phage genotype (1-12) in each replicate. Similarly, resistance was the proportion of phage genotypes resisted by a given host genotype (1-12) in each replicate. Means and 95% CIs are shown (n=8).

## [infectivity_1](infectivity_1.png)
Infectivity of phage from each timepoint (1,4, & 9) when challenged against hosts from each timepoint. Means and 95% CIs are shown (n=8)

## [infectivity_2](infectivity_2.png)
Infectivity of phage when challenged against hosts from each timepoint. Means and 95% CIs are shown (n=8)

## [replicate_diversity](replicate_diversity.png)
Spacer diversity in each replicate at each timepoint, over both CRISPR loci.

## [survplot](survplot.png)
Phage survival over the course of the experiment in each phage treatment.  

## [timepoint_diversity](timepoint_diversity.png)
Spacer diversity in each locus (CRISPR1 or 3) at each timepoint
