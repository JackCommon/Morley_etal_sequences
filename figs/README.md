## coevo_infect
Mean infectivity of phage when challenged againsts bacteria from different host environments (past, contemporary, future). Host environment refers to the time-shift relative to the phage e.g. host environment == past is when phage are challenged against hosts from timepoints preceeding them. The line is not predictive. 95% CIs are shown (n=8).

## coevo_resist
Mean resistance of hosts when challenged againsts bacteria from different host environments (past, contemporary, future). Simply 1- the values in coevo_infect. The line is not predictive. 95% CIs are shown (n=8).

## coverage_plot
Histogram of putative protospacer locations on the phage 2972 genome at each timepoint. Each point represents a sequenced host CRISPR loci that contained a sequence mapping to this region, derived from a BLAST search.
